= Parasoft Demo App

=== Spring Tool Suite 4 / Eclipse

. Problem: Error after import root project.
+
----
Project at 'D:\workspaces\pda-project\parasoft-demo-app' can't be named 'demo-app' because it's located directly under the workspace root. If such a project is renamed, Eclipse would move the container directory. To resolve this problem, move the project out of the workspace root or configure it to have the name 'parasoft-demo-app'.
----
+
====
Solution: 
Delete the imported root project. Rename the root project directory to `demo-app`. Import again.

. Problem: `parasoft-demo-app` Spring Boot application fail to start with the following description:
+
----
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Field buildProperties in com.parasoft.demoapp.service.BuildInfoService required a bean of type 'org.springframework.boot.info.BuildProperties' that could not be found.

The injection point has the following annotations:
	- @org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired(required=true)

The following candidates were found but could not be injected:
	- Bean method 'buildProperties' in 'ProjectInfoAutoConfiguration' not loaded because @ConditionalOnResource did not find resource '${spring.info.build.location:classpath:META-INF/build-info.properties}'


Action:

Consider revisiting the entries above or defining a bean of type 'org.springframework.boot.info.BuildProperties' in your configuration.

====
Solution: 
Run Gradle bootBuildInfo task(Either in *Gradle Tasks* view or with command `./gradlew bootBuildInfo` ), then *Refresh* the project (Not *Refresh Gradle Project*).
